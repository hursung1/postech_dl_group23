210509 Update the training base code
        -Due to the limitations of the lab computer, I confirmed that it runs without errors, but I haven't finished training.

In CNN_classificaition folder, there is code file named 'CNN_classification.ipynb', which is written by ipython notebook.
To run it, set data file of 'train_final.csv' and 'eval_final_open.csv' in the same folder.
After running, data file of 'sub_label.csv' that has infromation of label of test dataset.
